From multinational clinics to national care homes to private homecare organisations, we provide training services for healthcare organisations who are ready, willing and able to unlock international talent. Some of our clients have their own training centres and some of our clients prefer to send their nurses to us in Central London. Either option is fine and we can accommodate nurses near the Centre or the hospital where they do the training.
 <br><br />

We also provide a guarantee with all of our courses:
 <br><br />
 •OET <br />
•NMC CBT <br />
•NMC OSCE <br />
•GMC Plab 1 <br />
•GMC Plab 2 <br />
<p></p>
<p>Clients are given access to a dedicated portal (link) here where they can monitor their nurses’ progress as they complete their courses.</p>
