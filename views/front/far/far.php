                        IELTS Medical LTD was founded by the director of a London locum staffing firm who, through daily contact with overseas qualified medical professionals, identified the need for IELTS preparation classes tailored to medics that addresses the high standards required by the healthcare industry. <br><br>
                        Coming from a family of doctors, I have seen – first hand – the ups and the downs of working in the UK medical profession (both NHS and private healthcare). It is an honor to be a part of the solution. <br><br>
                        Each of the IELTS Medical educators has been selected for their extensive experience with the IELTS Academic, OET, NMC CBT, NMC OSCE and GMC Plab exams. We have a proven track record of guiding healthcare professionals to high scores and a first time pass for each exam. As a team, we’re enjoying helping our medics achieve the scores they need for registration with the GDC; GMC; GPhC, NMC and RCVS. So far, our medics taking the IELTS for the first time, have been able to do this in an <strong><i>average</i> of 50 days (approx. 7 weeks from their IELTS Level assessment to their exam).</strong><br><br>
                        They have done it and <strong>so can you.</strong> In fact, the highest compliment you could give us, is to allow us to be a part of your journey to registration. <br><br>
                        <strong>To your success.</strong><br><br>
                        -Founder, IELTS Medical LTD.
