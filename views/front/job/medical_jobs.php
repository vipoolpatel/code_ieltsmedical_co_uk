               <p>As well as providing courses for international doctors, we also assist our doctors with starting their UK medical careers. Through our relationships with NHS hospitals, UK based private hospitals and our partner recruitment firms, we can arrange interviews with hiring managers to help guide you into your first UK nursing position. In addition, our alumni are also willing to help you with your interview preparation to help give you the best possible chance of securing the position. As part of the process, we will introduce you to a suitable alumni-mentor to make your start in the UK as seamless as possible.
      </p>
      <p>We have seen many doctors into their first UK medical positions. Speak with our Account Executives for Medicine in order to find out how we can assist you too.
