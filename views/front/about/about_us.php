                      <p style="text-align: justify;">You only need to visit any major UK hospital to see that they are understaffed and medics are overworked. IELTS Medical is an organisation that is addressing this issue successfully by assisting overseas qualified healthcare professionals to navigate each hurdle. We intend to quadruple the number of healthcare professionals that we can tutor to pass the IELTS, OET, NMC CBT, NMC OSCE and GMC Plab each month. Our sessions are brought to you by IELTS Medical LTD. The IELTS Medical team consists of British Council certified examiners, experienced IELTS tutors, OET trainers, Clinical Nurse Educators and Medical Doctors who specialize in the aforementioned examinations. We deliver face-to-face and online sessions from our London base and provide training materials too. <br><br>

                       We delight in assisting our medics with reaching their professional goals and being there every step of the way: from IELTS/OET to work.</p>

                           Choosing the IELTS Medical was no doubt one of the best decisions I made in my life!
                           I passed my Osce on my first attempt!!
                           This 3-day intensive course I did with them was just brilliant!! All thanks to Nonny and Claire!!
                           I couldn’t have asked for any better trainer than the amazing, Claire..She was always upto date with her knowledge..ever so respectful and calm and patient with us all. Great study and practice materials too!! I would definitely recommend this institute to the overseas nurses looking for osce training. You won’t regret it guys!!

                           Having battled with IELTS for years, spending a whole lot in various training institutes not to mention the time, stress and emotional difficulties encountered. I decided to try OET after much encouragement from friends.
                           The educational, psychological and odd hours academic support provided by IELTS Medicals in a friendly and learning promoting environment is just more than SUPERB. A training institution which believes in individualised uniqueness and speed which has definitely paid off. Above all, God made it happen.
                           I strongly recommend IELTS Medicals, could have given more than 5 star if available.

                           As a young doctor having recently graduated, IELTS medical helped me achieve my career goal of working for the NHS in London through their vital support in OET exam. The courses were incredibly well delivered and tailored to my needs, I have been given the guidance, feedback and tips that helped me get the scores. I cannot thank Nonny enough for her kindness and ongoing support throughout this journey, as well as to the dedicated tutor Janet offering her support with dedication and professionalism. Thank you!
