                     	<h1>I am a Nurse</h1>
							<p>For overseas qualified nurses, there are generally three examinations that you will need to pass in order to satisfy the NMC’s Registration requirements:.<br><br>

							First of all, to satisfy the English language stage you can choose either the academic version of the International English Language Testing System aka IELTS or the Occupational English Test aka OET.  You do not have to do both and the one you choose is a personal decision. Almost every day, we speak to nurses who choose either the IELTS or the OET and they have sound reasons for their preferences.</p>

							<b>IELTS (Academic)</b>

						<u>Course fees from £198 online and £198 in person.</u><br><br>

						<b>OET (Nursing)</b>
						This exam tests your Listening, Reading, Speaking and Writing in a professional medical context. If you have practiced as a nurse and want to opt for an exam that is intent on emulating your workplace, then this is the exam for you. The NMC requires B-B-B-B across two sittings. <br><br>

						We have OET courses in person (see <a href="https://www.oetnurses.co.uk/"> www.oetnurses.co.uk </a>) and online (see: www.oetonline.net). <br><br>

						<u>Course fees from £209 online and £494 in person.</u> <br><br>
						Once you have cleared the English language stage, if you’re an EU nurse, that’s it! If you’re an overseas qualified nurse, the next stage is the nursing theory stage: <br><br>

						<b>NMC CBT</b>
						The exam tests your ability to apply theory to patient care and the questions relate to best practice in the UK. This includes testing your knowledge of acute and long term care and caring for healthy people. Similarly, requirements include: working within the community and caring for patients with complex needs and morbidity. The exam is multiple choice and features 120 questions and lasts for 4 hours. <br><br>

						To register for the exam, you will need to create an account on the NMC website. The NMC usually take 24 hours to check your eligibility and send you a decision letter via email. This email will include a link to the Pearson Vue website and your username and temporary password. Once logged in, you can schedule your CBT exam (eg. RN1: Registered Nurse – Adult). As of April 2019, the fee is now £90. <br><br>

                        We deliver courses in person and online for the NMC CBT examination and they’re led by Registered Practising Nurses and Clinical Educators. <br><br>

                        <u>Course fees from £150.48 online and £205 in person.</u> <br><br>

                        Finally, after successful completion of this stage, you should expect to receive a decision letter from the NMC, This letter will invite you to the final stage of registration which is the nursing practical or Objective Structured Clinical Examination also known as. <br><br>

						<b>NMC OSCE</b>
						The exam tests your ability to deliver practical care. There are 6 stations in the exam, that each last for fifteen minutes. The aim is to place you in scenario that mimics real life. Above all, in order to pass, you need to demonstrate competency. This is required in the areas that a UK trained nurse would be exposed to in practice. This includes: APIE, ANTT, Basic Life Support, Peak Flow, Removal of Foley Catheter, CSU Sample and IM Injections.
