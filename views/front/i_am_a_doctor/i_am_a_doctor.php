                     	<h1>I am a Doctor</h1>
							<p>As an overseas qualified doctor, there are generally three examinations that you will need to pass in order to satisfy the GMC’s Registration requirements. <br><br>

							First of all, to satisfy the English language stage you can choose either the academic version of the International English Language Testing System aka IELTS or the Occupational English Test aka OET.  You do not have to do both and the one you choose is a personal decision. Almost every day, we speak to doctors who choose either the IELTS or the OET and they have sound reasons for their preferences.</p>

						<b>IELTS (Academic)</b>
						This exam tests your Listening, Reading, Speaking and Writing in a generalized academic context. As of 1st October, 2019 this exam will also suffice for visa purposes. You’ll need a 7.5 overall and at least 7.0 each skill. The GMC requires you to achieve your scores in one sitting. Please note, that if you wish to apply to the UK Foundation Programme, you will need 7.5 in each skill. <br><br>

						You’re in the right place for tailored courses that aim to help you reach the high standards required by your regulator. We have IELTS courses in person and online. <br><br>

						<u>Course fees from £198 online and £198 in person.</u><br><br>

						<b>OET (Medicine)</b>
						This exam tests your Listening, Reading, Speaking and Writing in a professional medical context. If you have practised as a doctor and want to opt for an exam that is intent on emulating your workplace, then this is the exam for you. The GMC requires B-B-B-B across one sitting. <br><br>

						We have OET courses in person (see <a href="https://www.oetdoctors.co.uk/"> www.oetdoctors.co.uk </a>) and online (see: www.oetonline.net). <br><br>

						<u>Course fees from £209 online and &pound;494 in person.</u>
						Once you have cleared the English language stage, if you’re an EU doctor, that’s it! If you’re an overseas qualified doctor, the next stage is the medical theory stage: <br><br>

						<b>Plab 1</b>
						The exam tests your ability to apply theory to patient care. As such, all of the questions relate to best practice in the UK. This includes testing your knowledge of equipment that is readily available in hospitals all over the nation. As such, the exam covers acute, common or important conditions typically seen by trainees entering their second year of the UK Foundation Programme (F2), as well as the management of long term conditions seen in primary care. It’s made up of 180 MCQs (5 choices) that you will need to answer in three hours. <br><br>

						Finally, the last stage of GMC Registration is the medical practical or Objective Structured Clinical Examination also known as: <br><br>

						<b>Plab 2</b>
						Above all, this exam tests your ability to deliver practical care. It is made up of 18 scenarios that last for eight minutes. The aim is to place you in scenario that emulates real life. It includes a mock consultation on an acute ward for that reason. The examination covers everything that a UK trained doctor would be exposed to on the first day of Foundation Year Two (F2). Consequently, like Plab 1, all of the questions relate to current national best practice guidelines. <br><br>
