                      <p><strong>Results Case Study 1: Nurse L.</strong><br>
                         <i>Qualified in Italy</i><br><br>
                         <strong>Nurse L </strong><br>
                         <strong>Her journey.</strong><br>
                         Nurse L came into the centre one evening looking for a solution. Having qualified in Italy, the OET was the only thing between her and practicing as a nurse in one of the best Children’s hospitals in the country. She knew that passing the OET was something that she wanted. She also knew, however, that her healthcare assistant job required her 12 hours a day and 5 days each week. If she was going to do this and do this quickly, she needed an OET course provider that was equipped to deliver flexible courses.<br><br>
                           <u>Her journey.</u><br><br>
                          Nurse L received her schedule from the hospital a month in advance, meaning that when she enrolled, she was able to provide the dates and times of the 10 OET Flex Sessions she required. A benchmarking exercise during her first session highlighted OET writing as the only area she needed to concentrate her tuition efforts on and she chose the OET Flex Course to support this. The OET Flex course allows you to purchase 10; 20 or 30 sessions in advance and to select any vacant sessions between 10:00 am – 9:15 pm during the week or 10:00 – 17:00 on weekends. Nurse L spaced her course out across the month of May and then attended a single revision session one week before the exam.<br><br>

                           <strong>Her results.</strong><br>
                           Rather predictably, Nurse L achieved B-B-B-B across all 4 skills on her first attempt.

            <p><strong>Results Case Study 2: Dr. G.</strong><br>
               <i>Qualified in Nepal.</i><br><br>
              Our first meeting with Dr. G was in the prescence of his father and sister. They were easing him into the hustle and bustle of London from the beautiful and mountainous Nepal. He was new to language exams and was keen to give the OET a go.
 <br><br>
               <u>His journey</u><br><br>
            Dr. G opted for the 6 week OET (Medicine) Course that includes OET Grammar for Medicine and he diligently attended, ensuring that every box was ticked before the big day. Adapting to his new life, he enjoyed simultaneously learning the language that would serve him well in his new job and life as a UK based Medical Professional.
 <br><br>

                   <p><strong>Results Case Study 3: Nurse H</strong><br>
                  <i>Qualified in Japan.</i><br><br>
                  Nurse H already secured a nursing assistant job before she enrolled at the centre. Working side by side with nurses in a specialist hospital, however, gave her a glimpse into a clear career path that she wanted to pursue. Her hospital has an established OSCE program, so her task was to pass the IELTS and CBT. Coming from an academic background, she preferred the IELTS to the OET and had tried it once before, obtaining a 6.0 in Speaking and Writing. <br><br>
                   <u>Her journey.</u><br><br>
                   Nurse H practiced her IELTS Writing consistently across 4.5 weeks, as often as her schedule would allow. She completed her homework dutifully and incorporated the feedback she had received in each new piece. Towards the end of her journey, she felt as though she required Speaking coaching, and trained on her IELTS Academic Speaking 1:1 with her tutor. <br><br>

                    <strong>Her results.</strong><br>

                         <i>Qualified in the USA.</i><br><br>

                         What can we say about Nurse S? Having trained as a nurse in the US for some time, Nurse S was already a competent nurse. Why we remember him so vividly is because he was the first nurse that attended our course from Wednesday to Friday and had his exam on the following Monday! <br><br>
                           <u>His journey.</u><br><br>
                           Nurse S joined our intensive 3 day course and trained from 9am to 5pm on Wednesday to Friday. Our course is intensive and expertly led, but we always encourage our nurses to practice the skills that they have learnt on the course, over and over again. Leaving a short space of time between the course and the exam is a risky strategy. <br><br>
                           <u>His Results</u><br><br>
                           We were relieved to say that Nurse S achieved a full pass on his first attempt!

                         Dr. M arrived at IELTS Medical having taken the IELTS examination <strong>7 times.</strong> Working in one of the best hospitals in the world, he sought GMC registration in order to take that next step in his career. Hungry for qualification, <strong>Dr. M brought the drive to his IELTS preparation</strong> that creates magic when it meets <strong>the expertise of the IELTS Medical team.</strong><br><br>

                           Dr. M trained one:one with one of our IELTS Examiners and did so on a regular basis. Whilst working at his <strong>full time NHS job,</strong> he connected to our Examiner online for instruction and essay correction.

               Nurse E arrived at IELTS Medical with strong scores in her Reading, Listening and Speaking. Scoring 6.5 in her Writing, however, held her back from NMC registration. <br><br>
               <u>Her journey</u><br><br>
               Nurse E enrolled onto the <a href="https://ieltsmedical.co.uk/">I10 Advanced Writing course</a> and her determination to obtain a minimum of 7.0 in her Writing was evident. Even distance couldn’t stop her; from her home in Norwich, Nurse E consistently attended online writing sessions, produced writing for marking, incorporated tutors’ feedback into her work and diligently prepared to succeed. <br><br>

                         Pharmacist Z reached out to IELTS Medical from France and chose to study <a href="#">i10 Speaking</a> and <a href="#">i10 Writing</a> simultaneously. She had taken the exam once before and despite an excellent command of the English language, she knew that the first set of scores didn’t reflect her ability, and wanted to find out why. Our favourite quality of Pharmacist Z was that she took the IELTS exam like it was last time. For GPhC registration, she needed to score 7.0 in the IELTS exam.<br><br>
                           <u>Her journey</u><br><br>
                           Pharmacist Z prepared for the exam with laser-like efficiency. Attending every class and submitting every assignment, she partnered with another learner to practice before and after sessions with our Senior Tutor.  As the exam approached, she selected One:One Speaking classes with our examiner with additional Listening sessions for good measure.<br><br>

                           Dr. G already had strong scores in his Listening, Reading and Speaking from previous IELTS attempts. With registration deadlines looming, he sought our expertise to remedy the shortfall in his Writing. Choosing to learn one:one with our Senior Tutor, he attended lessons after work and completed an impressive number of essays for correction. His confidence at an all time high, he attempted the IELTS exam once more.<br><br>

                         <i>Qualified in Nigeria.</i><br><br>
                      We met Nurse N in late 2016. Herself and her husband had just started a family and she wanted to study for the IELTS exam part time. Nurse N had good English language skills, but felt unable to conquer IELTS Reading. Mid-preparation, however, she decided to give her studies a break. Nurse N returned to us in late 2018 after receiving our update about the NMC's acceptance of the OET. Her curiosity was piqued and she decided to switch from the IELTS, citing a preference for the OET's healthcare focus.

            </p>

            <p><u>Her journey</u></p>
            <p>Nurse N enrolled in our signature 3-week OET (Nursing) course and took the exam in February. To her delight, Nurse N scored a B in OET Reading as well as the OET Speaking and OET Listening. Unfortunately, however, she only managed a C+ in OET Writing. Undeterred, Nurse N returned for our OET Remedy Writing Course which exclusively focussed on that particular skill. Her second attempt yielded the results that she required (B-B-B-B).</p>
            <p>In April 2019, Nurse N enrolled on our 4-Day NMC CBT course (the penultimate stage of her NMC registration). This intensive Senior UK Registered Nurse-led course provided her with the tools and skills that she required to proceed to a first time CBT pass. Following this, Nurse N received an offer of employment from a partner NHS Trust.</p>
            <p>On Thursday 10th October, 2019 we received a text message from Nurse N advising us that she had passed her OSCE exam. </p>



            <p><strong>Nurse N is now a practicing Registered UK Nurse. </strong></p>

                        It was Mrs. G who reached out to us on her husband's behalf. Dr. G had taken the IELTS twice already and whilst he had strong scores in his IELTS Listening, Reading and Speaking, he was unable to crack the formidable IELTS Writing exam. Mrs. G diligently researched the exam, stumbling on the OET (Medicine). She called on his behalf and the rest was history. <br><br>

                           Dr. G enrolled on i10 OET (Writing) a one:one OET online course from his Nottingham home. Electing to study OET Writing 3 times each week from 10:00 - 12:15, he diligently produced OET letters that revealed an excellent grasp of the English language and an analytical approach to OET case note selection. <br><br>
